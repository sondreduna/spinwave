\section{The spin chain}

\subsection{Ground states}

In this section we initialise $10$ spins in random directions and simulate the time evolution for $J <0$ and $J>0$. The plots of the $z$-component of each of the spins over time is shown in figure \ref{fig:ferro} and \ref{fig:antiferro}. What is evident from these plots is that a positive coupling constant $J$ tends to make the spins align with their neighbours, while the negative constant tends to make them oppose them. This is a fact that is readily seen from inspecting the hamiltonian in \eqref{eq:hamiltionian}, since a positive $J$ makes the maximum of $\sum_{j,k} \mathbf{S}_j \cdot \mathbf{S}_k$ most energetically favourable, while a negative one makes its minimum most favourable. These two cases correspond to a ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic system respectively.

The reason for this being apparent when only plotting the $S_z$-component is the non-zero anisotropy-constant $d_z$. As seen from the hamiltonian, setting this positive will favour spins in the $z$-direction. This is also the reason that approximately half of the spins in the case of $J<0$ being directed along $\mathbf{e}_z$ while the others are directed along $-\mathbf{e}_z$.

\subsection{The magnon}

\subsubsection{Uncoupled system}

We initialise the system of $10$ spins with random orientations in space and set $J = 0$, $d_z = 1$, $\alpha = 0$ to demonstrate that all the spins precess in time. The trajectories of the $x$ and $y$ components of the spins is plotted in figure \ref{fig:precessionsxy}

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\columnwidth]{../fig/precession_xy.pdf}
	\caption{Trajectories of the $x$ and $y$ components of the $10$ randomly initialised spins.}
	\label{fig:precessionsxy}
\end{figure}

Next, we initialise all the spins along the $z$ direction except for one of them which we tilt slightly. Since there is no coupling between the spins, the precession of the first spin will not affect the others. Furthermore, when $\mathbf{S} = S\mathbf{e}_z$, the right hand side of the LLG \eqref{eq:llg} will be zero since the effective field is $\parallel \mathbf{e}_z$. As expected, this is also what is observed when simulating the system. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:precessions}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../fig/10_precessions.pdf}
	\caption{The figure shows uncoupled oscillations of the spin chain.}
	\label{fig:precessions}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Coupled system}

If we repeat the procedure used in the previous section except that we couple the spins with $J > 0$, we will observe that all the spins will start to precess, even if they are initialised along the $z$-axis. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:coupled_precessions}. Since the time evolution is hard to catch on a $2\mathrm{d}$ plot I have made a video showing the same as figure \ref{fig:coupled_precessions} \href{https://folk.ntnu.no/sondrdl/spinwaves/coupled.mp4}{here}. What is apparent here is that the neighbouring spins couple to each other. Since we are dealing with a finite system, I have chosen to use periodic boundary conditions, so that the first spin affects the last one and vice versa. Implementing this in python requires no effort at all as we can access the left hand neighbour of spin \texttt{i} with \texttt{i-1} regardless of the value of \texttt{i}, and the right hand neighbour with \texttt{(i-1)\%n} where \texttt{n} is the number of spins. This looks a bit artificial in the video, but it corresponds physically to arranging the linear chain in a circle. Another choice of boundary conditions is to simply say that the first and last spin only has \textit{one} neighbour. 

\begin{figure}[htb]

	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../fig/10_precessions_coupled.pdf}
	\caption{The figure shows coupled oscillations of the spins. A video displaying the same data set can be found \href{https://folk.ntnu.no/sondrdl/spinwaves/coupled.mp4}{here}.}
	\label{fig:coupled_precessions}
\end{figure}

If we are to simulate an infinite system we obviously cannot use a discrete model. However, the simulations above suggests that in the limit of \textit{many} spins we can describe the chain as a continuous wave. Then we would have to associate to every index $j$ a position in space 
$$
	\mathbf{S}_j(t) \to \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{x},t) \quad ; \quad j \to \mathbf{x},
$$
where $\mathbf{x}$ is the position of spin $j$.
If we approximate the directional derivatives along a lattice vector $\mathbf{a}$ by the finite differences 
$$
	 \|\mathbf{a}\|^2  \nabla^2 \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{x},t) \approx \|\mathbf{a}\|^2 \frac{\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{a},t) - 2 \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{x},t) + \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{x} + \mathbf{a},t) }{ \| \mathbf{a} \|^2}
$$
and 
$$
	\mathbf{a} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla} \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{x},t) \approx \|\mathbf{a}\| \frac{\mathbf{S}(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{a},t) - \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{a},t)}{2\|\mathbf{a}\|},
$$
we see that 
$$
	\mathbf{S}_{j-1}(t) + \mathbf{S}_{j+1}(t) \to \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{x},t) + \mathbf{a} \cdot \boldsymbol{\nabla} \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{x},t) + \frac{\| \mathbf{a} \|^2}{2} \nabla^2 \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{x},t) + \mathcal{O}(\|\mathbf{a}\|^2).
$$
Hence, in the limit of small lattice spacings $\|\mathbf{a}\| \to 0$ it should be possible to recast the LLG equation in a continuous form, as a PDE rather than an ode. A self contained discussion of this can be found in \cite{Lakshmanan2011}.
