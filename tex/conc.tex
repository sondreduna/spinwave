We have simulated the time evolution of various spin chains governed by a Hamiltonian including a variety of interactions. When there is non-zero coupling between the spins the local excitations, represented as tilting of the spins, propagate along the chain like a wave. This demonstrates the emergence of \textit{magnons}, which - much like phonons - are quantised waves. These excitations resemble real wave behaviour formally only in the limit of infinitely many spins, but the qualitative wave behaviour is seen to be captured within this simple model including only a small number of spins.
