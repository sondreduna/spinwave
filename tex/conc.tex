\textcolor{red}{Write more on conclusion. More detailed. Find some concrete results to point to.}

We have simulated the time evolution of various spin chains governed by different Hamiltonians. When there is non-zero coupling between the spins the local excitations propagate along the spins like a wave. This demonstrates the emergence of \textit{magnons}, which - much like phonons - are quantised waves, which only resemble real wave behaviour in the limit of infinitely many spins.
